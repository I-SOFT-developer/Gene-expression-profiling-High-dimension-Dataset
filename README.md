# Gene-expression-profiling-High-dimension-Dataset
In the field of molecular biology, gene expression profiling is the measurement of the activity (the expression) of thousands of genes at once, to create a global picture of cellular function. The Gene expression profilingdataset consists of twenty medical groups with have thousands of features. They are collected from two websites
Source:
first "https://github.com/rdiaz02/varSelRF-suppl-mat#data-files"  are nine gruops  (Nci, Brain_tumor1,Adenocarcinoma,Lymphoma,Leukemia,Breast3,Breast2,Prostate,Colon)
Second ": www.gems-system.org" are eleven groups.(14_tumors, 11_tumors, 9_tumors, brain_tumor1, brain_tumor2, leukemia1, leukemia2, lung_cancer, SRBCT, prostate_tumor, and DLBCL)
